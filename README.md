# Background images

This is a collection of somewhat arbitrary images which I find to be cool. They're mostly chosen due to their size (I recently got an UHD monitor and high resolution images that are good to look at are not always easy to find).

## Script to random background script

There's a simple script to set one of the images, chosen at random, to be the background image. It calls into the `feh` program under the hood. To run it, just

```bash
$ ./random_background
```
